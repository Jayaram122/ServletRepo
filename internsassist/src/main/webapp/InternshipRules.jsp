Additionally, please restrict phone calls related to your absence, late arrival, and other reporting activities to the hours between 7:30 am to 7:30 pm. Outside of this timeframe, kindly utilize text messages or email to notify the respective person in charge.</p>

Four instances of late arrivals or early departures will result in 1 day marked as leave in the intern's record. If you reach the office after 10:50 AM, it is considered a half day leave. Please ensure that the allotted break times are used. If you have to step out of the office during office hours, you are supposed to seek permission from the person in charge.</p>
